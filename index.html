    <p class="card-text">For mental health awareness month, I decided to build a better support system for NC medicaid recipients. Specifically those looking for mental health help on medicaid.
      <br>
        <b>How I did it:</b> I parsed a [15,000 page directory pdf](https://www.amerihealthcaritasnc.com/assets/pdf/provider-directory.pdf). After that, I manipulated it for search terms through google. After a google search was ran on the name of buisness, and a business on google places matches, we store that place. The format was a huge GeoJSON file, but wound up using it as a JS object anyways. I left the parsing/format code off of my github, because I feel it could be used for some not so nice things.
